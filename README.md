# Python-Workshop-FULLYHACKS2025

Heyyyy my fellow Pythonistas and or soon to be Pythonistas ðŸ’–!!!

I am your **`Intro to Python Workshop lead`**, you can call me **`Owen`**!
I will be teaching you the following in Python:

> Python's Simple Syntax

> Variables

> Conditions

> Loops

> Data Structures

> Functions

> Classes

> Importing

Python is the easiest language to learn due to its **minimal syntax** and **large amount** of **pre built functions**!

Make sure to **shower** and **`install Python3`** along with **`adding it to your PATH`** Environment variables when installing it.
* You can install it [***__here!__***](https://www.python.org/downloads)

It is also important that you all **dress in appropriate computer science attire** for my workshop! I am passionate about coding so its important to look the part and show off that you are all passionate as well! Attached to this message is an **outfit I deem appropriate for my workshop :3**

I will provide:
> My Slideshow Presentation

> Cloneable GitHub Repository (containing all the code samples I covered)

And Above All... my knowledge to you ensuring you are all able to code basic programs in Python by the end of our **`1 hour time together!`** Make sure to stop by from **`8pm - 9pm`**, it will be fun and you will learn a lot!

After the workshop we can (maybe) **touch grass**.

Definitions:

1. Python - The BEST programming language!

2. Showering - Cleaning yourself off using water and soap.

3. CS Attire - Outfit all CS majors will be using by the end of their degree. (Applies to me as well so dont worry!!!)

4. Grass - we will figure it out (maybe)...

5. Owen (also known as **`typos.`** on Discord) - Your silly workshop lead.
